Naming Conventions:
    File naming = Snake case
    Class naming = Pascal case
    Function names and Variable names = Snake case 

Creating installer:
    Install "pyinstaller" using pip.
    Use command "pyinstaller --exclude-module PySide6 main.py" from root dir.
    Also excluding "PySide6" binding as multiple bindings were creating problem for the installer pyinstaller.
    See more at "https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#options"

Comments:
    In future maybe we want to port to "PySide6" as it uses "LGPL" as license.
