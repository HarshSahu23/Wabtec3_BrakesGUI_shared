Naming Conventions:
    File naming = Snake case
    Class naming = Pascal case
    Function names and Variable names = Snake case 

Creating installer:
    Install "pyinstaller" using pip.
    Use command "pyinstaller --exclude-module PySide6 src/main.py" from root dir for GUI Application.
    Use command "pyinstaller --paths=src --exclude-module PySide6 src/frontend/cmd_toolset.py" from root dir for CLI Application.
    Look inside "dist" folder after running these commands to see the executables. 
    Also excluding "PySide6" binding as multiple bindings were creating problem for the installer pyinstaller.
    See more at "https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#options"

Comments:
    In future maybe we want to port to "PySide6" as it uses "LGPL" as license.
